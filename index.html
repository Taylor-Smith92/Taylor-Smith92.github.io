		<h2>Passion Project Paragraph</h2>
		<p>As a musician I have trained in balancing the creative side of my mind with the logical to produce a desired end product.
			I used my creativity to think about different subjects that would be interesting to write about and with what musical elements they would pair
			or contrast with in a suitable way. I would take these elements and work them out through improvisation and experimentation seeing where
			I could push boundaries and where I needed to have structure. Then once I was happy with the theoretical construct of my piece I would begin to set
			the actual framework making sure that all of the elements I had chosen would function the way I had planned them to.

		<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
		<h4>Week 1</h4>
		<p>The first week has gone by quickly and it feels good to say the least. As as new coder I had some anxiety about being in the bootcamp environment but I feel confident in the work I've done.
		It seems that this first week was more or less a review of the prework which was unexpected compared to how the program is generally describe but also made
		entering into this new field more reassuring. The tech update at Fat Pipe was very interesting to be apart of. I unfortunately did not understand most of the technical talk but I was able to
		take away from that event that New Mexico has a far greater tech presence than I had previously thought and perhaps with that a greater variety of development jobs.</p>
		<h4>Week 2</h4>
		<p>This week we mostly worked on mySQL which started out straight forward but has quickly developed into a complex topic. I'm not sure I understand fully
			how everything connects but I think I am starting to get small parts here and there.
			The UNM App Contest was an interesting end to the week.
			I have previously heard of the contest before but never had attended the actual presentation however I was able to see most of the demonstrations this year and I was rather impressed with the entries.
			It was especially inspiring to hear that some of the contestants were from previous Deep Dive cohorts.
			One of the demonstrations that was most memorable to me brought up an important concept regarding the legality of what we can do as developers
			and really how important it is to fully consider a project concept before spending time and resources developing something that wont result
			in a functional end. </p>
