		<h2>Passion Project Paragraph</h2>
		<p>As a musician I have trained in balancing the creative side of my mind with the logical to produce a desired end product.
			I used my creativity to think about different subjects that would be interesting to write about and with what musical elements they would pair
			or contrast with in a suitable way. I would take these elements and work them out through improvisation and experimentation seeing where
			I could push boundaries and where I needed to have structure. Then once I was happy with the theoretical construct of my piece I would begin to set
			the actual framework making sure that all of the elements I had chosen would function the way I had planned them to.

		<p>The first picture represents my career path before Deep Dive. I was trying to find my way but even with help from others I never made any real progress.
			Nothing seemed to work for me and looking back now I still dont understand why previous opportunities failed. Never the less just like that house
			all of my previous career paths have gone up in flames leaving me with only one viable option. I have to rebuild from the ground up. During this boot-camp
			I am pouring the foundation, learning the fundamentals and creating good work habits. Afterwards I will build the framework of the house most likely by
			attaining an internship or some other kind of lower level development position to fine tune my skills will beginning the work on my passion project.
			Finally when I am comfortable with my abilities I will be self employed as a freelance developer/game designer and my house will be built.

		<h2>Forbidden Island</h2>
		<p>This in-class activity was technically my first play through of Forbidden Island although I own and play the sequel Forbidden Desert regularly and I have
			previously read the rules of Forbidden Island and was generally aware of the rules. However my team did not win our game. While we did have great communication and
			were on our way to developing the winning strategy my folly resulted in our loss. I forgot that in this game of Forbidden Island a player can only
			have five cards in a hand at one time, which I did comply with at first, inevitably ruining our statistical margins. Although I had far greater knowledge going into the
			game relative to my team I still allowed myself to overlook a basic rule and was responsible for our loss. I think this speaks a lot about my personality and work ability.
			I strive to understand the whole picture and can often find myself overlooking the most basic of concepts.</p>

		<h2>Salary Expectations and Potential</h2>
		<p>I have done some research into average salary for web developers and in conjunction with what I have heard from my peers I expect to be offered an initial salary of 30-40K.
			I have heard a few stories of people starting around 50K and I believe that the national average is around 100K but I dont believe this is to be expected in New Mexico.
			I want to have a salary of 40K and I dont think I can accept an offer for less unless the position has other opportunities associated with it. That being said I
			dont expect to have a problem with the pay of my future web developer career I am more concerned with finding the right job and having a good interview. From a company
			perspective I will demonstrate a high potential because I am asking for a reasonable starting salary and my experience is rooted in actual job training.

			<li><strong>Why: </strong> I wanted to choose an organization that had something to do with the arts and through my research I found the Music Guild of New Mexico who give grants to other music based non-profits.</li>
			<li><strong>Strategy: </strong>I intend to reach out to Susan Georgia via email, explain my skill set, and suggest that I could aid with any development needs including a redesign of the web page.</li>

			<li><strong>Why: </strong>I have shopped at this business before and while it's being run well I dont think that they are maximizing their local presence and I would like
				to help them grow. I'm hoping that by reaching out to a small business I can gain a better perspective on what skills I will need to help my clients long term rather
				than focusing on skills that are purely for my benefit.</li>
			<li><strong>Strategy: </strong>Unfortunately my main contact does not have a Linked In profile or any public contact info on his Facebook page. I believe my best course
				of action will be to first send an email to the generic account and/or call the store front. If I dont receive a reply I will then visit the store front with my resume
				and try out my elevator pitch.</li>

		<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
		<h4>Week 1</h4>
		<p>The first week has gone by quickly and it feels good to say the least. As as new coder I had some anxiety about being in the bootcamp environment but I feel confident in the work I've done.
		It seems that this first week was more or less a review of the prework which was unexpected compared to how the program is generally describe but also made
		entering into this new field more reassuring. The tech update at Fat Pipe was very interesting to be apart of. I unfortunately did not understand most of the technical talk but I was able to
		take away from that event that New Mexico has a far greater tech presence than I had previously thought and perhaps with that a greater variety of development jobs.</p>
		<h4>Week 2</h4>
		<p>This week we mostly worked on mySQL which started out straight forward but has quickly developed into a complex topic. I'm not sure I understand fully
			how everything connects but I think I am starting to get small parts here and there.
			The UNM App Contest was an interesting end to the week.
			I have previously heard of the contest before but never had attended the actual presentation however I was able to see most of the demonstrations this year and I was rather impressed with the entries.
			It was especially inspiring to hear that some of the contestants were from previous Deep Dive cohorts.
			One of the demonstrations that was most memorable to me brought up an important concept regarding the legality of what we can do as developers
			and really how important it is to fully consider a project concept before spending time and resources developing something that wont result
			in a functional end.</p>
		<h4>Week 3</h4>
		<p>I'm not sure how I feel about week three. On one hand I know that I am actually retaining at least the basics of this material,
			but on the other hand I'm realizing just how much I have left to learn. We started learning css this week and it has lived up to it's reputation.
			On the surface it seemed so simple "it's just styling" I thought but as with all aspects of coding there is far more involved with css than I thought.
			Luckily this week's friday Tech and Art lectures offered quite the contrast. I have a history has a musician and although my immediate goals involve using my developer skills
			to earn a wage my long term plan is to return to my artist roots. It was very impressive to see how forward pressing the digital media program is even
			if only a few of it students have gotten into AR.</p>
		<h4>Week 4</h4>
		<p>With the fourth week having ended I have officially begun to worry about what I will be able to accomplish before the end of the program.
			I feel like I am keeping up with the expectations at a base level but I want to be further along than I am or perhaps assumed that I would be by
			now. This next week we need to start unit testing for capstone projects and that is also worrisome. The assignments have quickly developed from
			basic fundamental work into fully fledged projects, almost out of no where, and although I am excited for the challenge I also am cautious to
			proceed. This week has also involved a lot of introspection about my future path toward self employment and entrepreneurship. I want to eventually
			work for myself however that requires a confidence in one's skill set that I'm not sure I have or will have by the end of week 10. This feeling
			was not helped by this weeks speakers either. Although it was inspiring to hear everyone's success stories I can't help but compare myself and
			specifically my drive to that of the speakers and I just hope that I can one day be as fearless.</p>
		<h4>Week 5</h4>
		<p>It's almost hard to believe that boot camp is already half way over, we're five weeks in but it feels like it's been five days. We have just started unit testing for our
			capstone projects and the challenge is living up to it's expectations. It doesn't help that our database is larger than the other groups so as it took us longer to get
			started it seems other groups have already passed multiple classes through testing, which is frustrating. I hope that my group will be able to solve our errors quickly and
			catch up to the pace but I have a feeling that we will be struggling on this step for a while. Pro dev was a great way to end this week and it kind of changed my thoughts
			on job opportunities. The GAP lecture seemed like an odd addition to the line up at first but the way they described the work and the type of problems they are tasked with
			solving impressed me. I guess I still have a negative opinion about big corporate businesses but the GAP team definitely did not conform to my expectations and have opened
			my eyes to more possible career paths.
