		<h2>Passion Project Paragraph</h2>
		<p>As a musician I have trained in balancing the creative side of my mind with the logical to produce a desired end product.
			I used my creativity to think about different subjects that would be interesting to write about and with what musical elements they would pair
			or contrast with in a suitable way. I would take these elements and work them out through improvisation and experimentation seeing where
			I could push boundaries and where I needed to have structure. Then once I was happy with the theoretical construct of my piece I would begin to set
			the actual framework making sure that all of the elements I had chosen would function the way I had planned them to.
