		<h2>Passion Project Paragraph</h2>
		<p>As a musician I have trained in balancing the creative side of my mind with the logical to produce a desired end product.
			I used my creativity to think about different subjects that would be interesting to write about and with what musical elements they would pair
			or contrast with in a suitable way. I would take these elements and work them out through improvisation and experimentation seeing where
			I could push boundaries and where I needed to have structure. Then once I was happy with the theoretical construct of my piece I would begin to set
			the actual framework making sure that all of the elements I had chosen would function the way I had planned them to.

		<p>The first picture represents my career path before Deep Dive. I was trying to find my way but even with help from others I never made any real progress.
			Nothing seemed to work for me and looking back now I still dont understand why previous opportunities failed. Never the less just like that house
			all of my previous career paths have gone up in flames leaving me with only one viable option. I have to rebuild from the ground up. During this boot-camp
			I am pouring the foundation, learning the fundamentals and creating good work habits. Afterwards I will build the framework of the house most likely by
			attaining an internship or some other kind of lower level development position to fine tune my skills will beginning the work on my passion project.
			Finally when I am comfortable with my abilities I will be self employed as a freelance developer/game designer and my house will be built.

		<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
		<h4>Week 1</h4>
		<p>The first week has gone by quickly and it feels good to say the least. As as new coder I had some anxiety about being in the bootcamp environment but I feel confident in the work I've done.
		It seems that this first week was more or less a review of the prework which was unexpected compared to how the program is generally describe but also made
		entering into this new field more reassuring. The tech update at Fat Pipe was very interesting to be apart of. I unfortunately did not understand most of the technical talk but I was able to
		take away from that event that New Mexico has a far greater tech presence than I had previously thought and perhaps with that a greater variety of development jobs.</p>
		<h4>Week 2</h4>
		<p>This week we mostly worked on mySQL which started out straight forward but has quickly developed into a complex topic. I'm not sure I understand fully
			how everything connects but I think I am starting to get small parts here and there.
			The UNM App Contest was an interesting end to the week.
			I have previously heard of the contest before but never had attended the actual presentation however I was able to see most of the demonstrations this year and I was rather impressed with the entries.
			It was especially inspiring to hear that some of the contestants were from previous Deep Dive cohorts.
			One of the demonstrations that was most memorable to me brought up an important concept regarding the legality of what we can do as developers
			and really how important it is to fully consider a project concept before spending time and resources developing something that wont result
			in a functional end.</p>
		<h4>Week 3</h4>
		<p>I'm not sure how I feel about week three. On one hand I know that I am actually retaining at least the basics of this material,
			but on the other hand I'm realizing just how much I have left to learn. We started learning css this week and it has lived up to it's reputation.
			On the surface it seemed so simple "it's just styling" I thought but as with all aspects of coding there is far more involved with css than I thought.
			Luckily this week's friday Tech and Art lectures offered quite the contrast. I have a history has a musician and although my immediate goals involve using my developer skills
			to earn a wage my long term plan is to return to my artist roots. It was very impressive to see how forward pressing the digital media program is even
			if only a few of it students have gotten into AR.</p>
