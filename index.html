		<h2>Passion Project Paragraph</h2>
		<p>As a musician I have trained in balancing the creative side of my mind with the logical to produce a desired end product.
			I use my creativity to think about topic matter and what musical elements would pair well with it.
			This usually would include the use of improvisation and a "trial by error" methodology just to get a sense of the space I want the piece to have.
			Then once I am happy with the general construct of my piece I begin to think about the actual framework for things like the time signature, then the key and chord transitions, next adding vocals, .
